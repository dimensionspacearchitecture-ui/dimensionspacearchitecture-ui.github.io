      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          <strong>Dimension Space Architecture</strong> is a boutique architectural design practice based in
          Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, founded by <strong>Phil Austen</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The studio is driven by a belief that good architecture should feel effortless —
          spaces that are calm, intuitive, and shaped around the people who live and work within them.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Every project begins with listening. Understanding how a space should feel is just as important
          as how it functions. Dimension Space Architecture works closely with clients to translate ideas,
          aspirations, and practical needs into architecture that feels personal, considered, and enduring.
        </p>

        <p>
          Design is approached with a strong emphasis on <strong>spatial clarity, materiality, and environmental response</strong>.
          Careful material selection is central to the process — ensuring buildings not only look good on day one,
          but age gracefully over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Designed for Unique Environments</h2>
        <p>
          Designing in the Bay of Plenty presents both challenges and opportunities. Sun, wind, salt air,
          humidity, and seasonal living patterns all influence how a building performs and how it is experienced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having lived, designed, and built locally for many years, Dimension Space Architecture brings a
          deep understanding of how to respond thoughtfully to coastal and high-exposure environments,
          balancing comfort, durability, and longevity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Guidance Through the Process</h2>
        <p>
          The modern building and planning landscape can feel overwhelming. The studio provides clear,
          practical guidance through <strong>New Zealand building code requirements, planning controls,
          and consent processes</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          High-quality <strong>3D visualisation and virtual walkthroughs</strong> are also available,
          allowing clients to experience their home before construction begins and make informed decisions early.
        </p>

        <h2>Thinking About a Granny Flat?</h2>
        <p>
          Many homeowners are now exploring secondary dwellings or granny flats to support extended family
          living, rental income, or future flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          New legislation expected in <strong>2026</strong> will allow for unconsented granny flats of up to
          <strong>70m²</strong>, subject to specific criteria. Dimension Space Architecture can assist with
          design, planning considerations, and navigating applicable regulations to ensure a seamless outcome.
