      <p>
        <strong>Dimension Space Architecture</strong> is a boutique architectural design practice based in
        Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, founded by <strong>Phil Austen</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With many years of experience in architecture, the practice focuses on creating bespoke residential,
        multi-unit, and light commercial spaces that are carefully tailored to the people who inhabit them.
        Each project begins with listening — understanding how a space should feel, function, and evolve
        over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dimension Space Architecture approaches design with a strong emphasis on
        <strong>spatial clarity, materiality, and environmental response</strong>.
        Particular care is given to material selection, ensuring finishes are not only visually refined
        but also durable and appropriate for their setting. This is especially important in coastal and
        high-exposure environments, where climate, salt air, and sun significantly influence how buildings
        perform and age.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phil Austen lives in the Bay of Plenty with his wife, Alex, and has called the region home for over
        a decade. Having designed, built, and lived in multiple homes locally, he brings first-hand
        understanding of the region’s climate and the complexities involved in delivering well-considered
        architecture in this environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The practice provides clear guidance through <strong>New Zealand building code requirements,
        planning controls, and consent processes</strong>, helping clients navigate what can often feel like
        a complex regulatory landscape. To support informed decision-making,
        <strong>3D visualisation and virtual walkthroughs</strong> are offered, allowing clients to
        experience their space before construction begins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dimension Space Architecture also assists clients considering <strong>secondary dwellings or granny
        flats</strong>, including advice on upcoming legislation expected in <strong>2026</strong>, which
        will allow for unconsented granny flats of up to <strong>70m²</strong>, subject to specific criteria.
        The practice can assist with design, planning considerations, and compliance requirements to ensure
        these additions integrate seamlessly with existing homes.
